## Mission

Write a manuscript that reads like it was written by a native English-speaking senior researcher. Academic rigor meets narrative clarity. Every sentence must earn its place.

---

## Target Language: English (academic, formal)

## Manuscript Structure (Lancet Planetary Health format)

### Title (~15 words)
**"Who Suffers Most? Causal Machine Learning Reveals Heterogeneous Health Effects of Air Pollution Across 27 Brazilian State Capitals"**

### Structured Abstract (300 words max)
- **Background:** Air pollution causes X deaths/year in Brazil. Current policy uses uniform thresholds. Effect heterogeneity is unmeasured.
- **Methods:** Honest Causal Forests + DML across 27 capitals (2022-2025). 5 integrated data sources. CATE by age, sex, fleet density, DTR, region. SHAP for explainability.
- **Findings:** [Results TBD — placeholder structure]
- **Interpretation:** [Policy implications — differentiated alerts, CONAMA revision evidence]
- **Funding:** [TBD]

### Body (~4,500 words for Lancet PH)

| Section | Words | Content |
|---------|-------|---------|
| Introduction | 800 | Hook → context → gap → promise (from STORYTELLING.md) |
| Methods | 1,200 | Study design, data, causal framework, estimation, sensitivity (from methodology-specialist) |
| Results | 1,200 | ATE → CATE heterogeneity → SHAP → policy counterfactuals |
| Discussion | 1,300 | Meaning → comparison → strengths → limitations → policy implications → conclusion |

### Writing Standards

| Rule | Example |
|------|---------|
| Active voice preferred | "We estimated..." not "It was estimated..." |
| Specific numbers | "2.3-fold higher (95% CI: 1.8-2.9)" not "significantly higher" |
| One paragraph = one idea | No paragraph covers >1 concept |
| Topic sentence first | Each paragraph opens with its main claim |
| Hedging when appropriate | "Our findings suggest..." for causal claims under assumptions |
| No jargon without definition | Define CATE, SHAP, CLAN on first use |
| Present results in past tense | "The causal forest estimated..." |
| Discussion in present tense | "These findings indicate..." |

## Section Drafting Plan

### Phase 4 — Week 1
- [ ] Draft Introduction (from STORYTELLING.md narrative arc)
- [ ] Draft Methods (from methodology-specialist spec)
- [ ] Draft Results (from data-specialist tables and figures)

### Phase 4 — Week 2
- [ ] Draft Discussion
- [ ] Write Abstract (last — after all sections)
- [ ] Internal review with @scientific-storytelling for narrative coherence
- [ ] Internal review with @statistical-reviewer for statistical language

### Phase 5
- [ ] Format for Journal A (Lancet PH: 4,500 words)
- [ ] Prepare longer version for Journal B (EHP: 6,000 words) as backup
- [ ] Final proofread and polish

---

## Tasks

- [ ] Draft all manuscript sections
- [ ] Incorporate feedback from @scientific-storytelling and @statistical-reviewer
- [ ] Ensure word count compliance
- [ ] Write figure captions (precise, self-contained)
- [ ] Write supplementary methods text
- [ ] Final proofread before @journal-formatter
