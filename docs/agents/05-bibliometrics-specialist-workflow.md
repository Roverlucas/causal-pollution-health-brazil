# @bibliometrics-specialist — Workflow & Responsibilities

> **Role:** Map the scientific landscape — authors, clusters, trends, co-citation networks
> **Active:** Phase 1
> **Tier:** 1 — Evidence & Scientific Base

## Mission

Quantify the research landscape to position our study precisely. Identify key authors, emerging trends, and where the field is heading — ensuring we don't replicate existing work and that we cite the right people.

## Deliverables

### Bibliometric Report (Phase 1)

1. **Publication trends (2015-2026):** papers/year in air pollution-health + causal ML
2. **Top authors & institutions:** who leads the field; potential reviewers to suggest/avoid
3. **Co-citation network:** which papers are commonly cited together → intellectual structure
4. **Keyword co-occurrence:** which topics cluster; emerging terms (e.g., "causal forest" + "environmental")
5. **Geographic distribution:** which countries publish most; Brazil's position
6. **Journal landscape:** which journals publish this topic; confirms our A/B/C selection
7. **Research front identification:** last 2-3 years' fastest-growing clusters

### Positioning Map
A 2×2 matrix showing:
- X-axis: Methodological sophistication (traditional → causal ML)
- Y-axis: Geographic scope (single city → multi-city/national)
- Our study: top-right quadrant (first in that position for Brazil)

## Tools & Methods

- **VOSviewer:** Co-citation and keyword co-occurrence visualization
- **Bibliometrix (R):** Publication trends, Bradford's law, Lotka's law
- **Scopus/WoS export:** Raw bibliographic data
- **Lens.org:** Open alternative for validation

## Tasks

- [ ] Export bibliographic records from Scopus/WoS (search strings from @literature-specialist)
- [ ] Run bibliometric analysis (trends, top authors, co-citation)
- [ ] Generate keyword co-occurrence map
- [ ] Create positioning 2×2 matrix
- [ ] Identify potential reviewer suggestions (top authors in our niche)
- [ ] Deliver report to @study-conductor and @scientific-storytelling
