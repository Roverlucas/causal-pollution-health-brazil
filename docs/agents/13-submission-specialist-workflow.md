## Deliverables

### Cover Letter (Journal A — Lancet Planetary Health)

**Structure:**
1. **Opening hook** (1 sentence): Why this matters now
2. **Gap statement** (2 sentences): What's missing in the literature
3. **What we did** (2-3 sentences): Method + scope in plain language
4. **Key finding** (2 sentences): Most dramatic result
5. **Why this journal** (2 sentences): Explicit fit with Lancet PH scope
6. **Novelty statement** (1 sentence): First study to...
7. **Policy relevance** (1 sentence): Direct implications for CONAMA/MonitoAr
8. **Closing** (1 sentence): Standard submission statement

**Tone:** Confident but not arrogant. Evidence-based assertions. No hyperbole.

### Highlights (for Environment International backup)
1. First application of causal machine learning to air pollution-health in Latin America
2. Heterogeneous effects revealed: elderly in high-fleet cities face 2-5× higher risk
3. 27 state capitals analyzed simultaneously — largest multi-city scope in Brazilian env-health
4. SHAP-based explanations make causal heterogeneity transparent for policymakers
5. Policy counterfactuals quantify preventable hospitalizations under WHO vs CONAMA standards
