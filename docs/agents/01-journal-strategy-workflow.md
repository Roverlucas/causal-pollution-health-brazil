## Mission

Select optimal journals A/B/C and ensure the manuscript is positioned to maximize editorial interest, minimize desk-reject risk, and align with each journal's scope, audience, and impact.

## Journal Analysis

### Journal A — The Lancet Planetary Health (IF 24.1)

**Why:** Premier venue for climate-health-policy intersection. Explicitly seeks global south evidence. Published critical editorial on Brazil's CONAMA standards (2024). Audience: policymakers + clinicians + researchers.

**Fit factors:**
- ✅ Multi-country/multi-city environmental health studies
- ✅ Policy-relevant findings with explicit recommendations
- ✅ Causal inference emphasis (moving beyond associations)
- ✅ Global south data with global implications
- ✅ Open access (Wellcome Trust funding compatible)

**Formatting:**
- Research Article: 4,500 words max (excl. abstract, refs, tables, figures)
- Structured abstract: 300 words (Background, Methods, Findings, Interpretation, Funding)
- Max 5 figures/tables combined
- STROBE checklist required
- Cover letter MUST state novelty and policy relevance explicitly

**Risk:** High selectivity (~5% acceptance). Desk-reject if framing is too technical/methodological rather than policy-driven.

**Adaptation:** Lead with policy implications. Frame causal forests as *enabling better policy*, not as a methodological advance per se. "Who suffers most" narrative front and center.

### Journal B — Environmental Health Perspectives (IF 11.0)

**Why:** Gold standard for environmental health epidemiology. Open access (NIEHS). Published foundational DLNM and exposure-response studies. Audience: environmental epidemiologists.

**Fit factors:**
- ✅ Multi-city air pollution-health studies
- ✅ Methodological innovation welcome
- ✅ Emphasis on reproducibility and open science
- ✅ Strong tradition of Brazilian collaborators

**Formatting:**
- Research Article: 6,000 words (excl. abstract, refs)
- Unstructured abstract: 250 words
- Max 6 figures/tables
- Supplementary material encouraged
- Data availability statement required
- Code repository required (GitHub)

**Risk:** Moderate selectivity (~15%). May request additional sensitivity analyses.

**Adaptation:** More methodological detail allowed. Include full sensitivity/robustness section. Emphasize causal identification strategy. Compare with traditional methods (GAM, DLNM).

---

### Journal C — Environment International (IF 11.8)

**Why:** Broad environmental science scope. Accepts longer manuscripts. Strong track record for multi-city pollution studies in developing countries.

**Fit factors:**
- ✅ Air quality and health studies are core scope
- ✅ Machine learning applications accepted
- ✅ Multi-city designs valued
- ✅ Supplementary material generous

**Formatting:**
- Research Article: 8,000 words
- Structured or unstructured abstract
- No strict figure limit
- Supplementary material unlimited
- Graphical abstract required

**Risk:** Lower selectivity (~25%) but also lower prestige. Use as safety net.

**Adaptation:** Can include more technical detail. Full methodology exposition. Graphical abstract is a must — commission @visual-impact-specialist early.

---

## Backup Journal — American Journal of Epidemiology (IF 5.0)

**Why:** Published the practical guide for Honest Causal Forests in epidemiology (Wen et al., 2023). Natural home for methodological application paper. Would be seen as "applying what AJE taught."

**Fit:** Perfect methodological alignment. Moderate impact but high credibility.

## Submission Strategy

```
Round 1: Lancet Planetary Health (Journal A)
  → If desk-reject (expected 2-4 weeks):
Round 2: Environmental Health Perspectives (Journal B)
  → If reject after review (~3-4 months):
Round 3: Environment International (Journal C) or AJE
```

**Parallel prep:** Format for Lancet Planetary Health first (most restrictive: 4,500 words, 5 figures). Longer versions for B/C are easier to expand than to cut.

## Tasks

- [x] Analyze journal scope, IF, acceptance rates
- [x] Define A/B/C ranking with rationale
- [x] Document formatting requirements per journal
- [x] Define submission strategy cascade
- [ ] Review final manuscript for Journal A fit (Phase 4)
- [ ] Adapt formatting if journal switch needed (Phase 5)
