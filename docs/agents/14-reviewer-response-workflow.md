## Mission

Turn reviewer criticism into manuscript improvement. Every comment gets a respectful, evidence-based response. Strategic framing: agree where valid, defend where necessary, exceed expectations where possible.

---

## Response Strategy Framework

### For each reviewer comment:

1. **Classify:** Major concern / Minor concern / Suggestion / Editorial
2. **Assess:** Valid / Partially valid / Misunderstanding / Unreasonable
3. **Plan:** Accept + revise / Partially accept + explain / Respectfully disagree with evidence
4. **Execute:** Make change → show change → explain rationale
5. **Format:** Point-by-point with original comment quoted

### Response Letter Template

```
Dear Editor,

We thank the reviewers for their constructive feedback, which has
strengthened our manuscript. Below we provide point-by-point responses
to each comment. Changes in the revised manuscript are highlighted in

| Short time window | "Our strength is spatial breadth (27 capitals). We provide explicit discussion of the temporal limitation and..." |
| Ecological fallacy | "Our target of inference is the population-level causal effect, which is the relevant quantity for public policy..." |
